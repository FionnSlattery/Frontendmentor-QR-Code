Hi Guys,

First time submitting a solution and still a beginner to coding with HTML and CSS. Couple of areas i want a little bit of help with.

1. Struggled with knowing how and when to use flexbox or in general how to position items on my page. (particularly centering objects) Tips greatly appreciated.
2. Media queries to make the project responsive for mobile. Not sure if i did it correct but it looks fine on my phone but this might not be the case on another persons phone. Should i have added more queries such as a max-width or min-width to help with this.
3. Since i am new to this i am open to any and all constructive criticism for stuff like useless code and untidy work etc.

Thanks in advance.
